# Epic Games Website
My project involves creating a website inspired by Epic Games, designed to serve as a dynamic platform for gaming enthusiasts. The website will allow users to browse and download games while providing a 
personalized experience through game recommendations. It will also feature a community section for gamers to connect, discuss, and share their experiences through the support page. The goal is to create an engaging,
user-friendly interface that delivers a seamless gaming and shopping experience, catering to both casual players and hardcore gamers.

This project emphasizes modern web technologies and responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices, providing gamers with easy access to their favorite content anytime, anywhere. 
By integrating game recommendations and community-driven features, the website aims to become a one-stop destination for gaming, fostering both convenience and connection.

## Design Process

I started off by thinking about common problems gamers face, like confusing layouts and hard-to-find games. Then, I sketched out ideas for how the website should look and work. The goal was to make everything feel smooth and simple, whether someone is buying a game or trying to learn more about the company. By focusing on what people need and using modern design techniques, my website will help gamers and developers connect in a way that’s fun and easy.

The design process for my website focused on understanding what gamers really want. Gamers need a simple and fun way to discover games. To make this happen, I designed a website that’s easy to use, personalized for each user, and packed with features like a game store, recommendations, support area and a home page that lists information about the company. An example of this is the having a support page, as a gamer that wants to give their feedback on our games or even our website, they can easily write in a support ticket and we will be able to get back to them via email.

I used a wireframe on github to first think of an idea before i coded it
